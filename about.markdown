# About Pragmatic AI

Pragmatic AI is a set of principles for building effective, reliable, and ethical AI systems. These principles are inspired by the Pragmatic Programming movement and extend those ideas to the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to promote a practical, value-driven approach to AI development that prioritizes:

- Real business value over technical novelty
- Explainability and transparency
- Security and ethical considerations
- Simplicity and iterative development
- Human oversight and accountability

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions and discussions around these principles. Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pragmatic-ai/pragmatic-ai.github.io) to get involved.
