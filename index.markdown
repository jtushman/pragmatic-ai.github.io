# Pragmatic AI - Core Principles
*Version 0.0.1*

### Value-Driven Development
- Focus on delivering real business value rather than implementing AI for its own sake
- Ask "Does this AI solution solve an actual problem?" before proceeding
- Measure success by outcomes, not model complexity

### Explainability by Default
- Prioritize approaches where decisions can be understood by stakeholders
- Consider explainability as a primary feature, not a nice-to-have
- Balance performance with transparency appropriately

### Start Simple, Iterate Often
- Begin with the simplest solution that could possibly work
- Add complexity only when simpler approaches prove insufficient
- Continuous improvement over big-bang deployments

### Tracer Bullet Development
- Build end-to-end thin slices of functionality early
- Validate that your AI solution integrates properly with existing systems
- Establish a learning pipeline from the beginning

### Design for Testability
- Create AI systems where outputs can be verified objectively
- Define clear performance metrics and baselines
- Test not just for accuracy, but for bias, robustness, and edge cases

### Data Pragmatism
- Recognize that data quality often matters more than algorithm sophistication
- Spend more time on data preparation than model tuning
- Understand your data's limitations and biases

### Orthogonality
- Design AI components with clear, limited responsibilities
- Create systems that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently
- Minimize unexpected interactions between components

### Reversibility
- Make architectural choices that don't lock you into specific AI frameworks
- Prepare for rapidly evolving technology and approaches
- Design for model swappability

### Meaningful Human Oversight
- Design AI systems with appropriate human supervision at critical decision points
- Create clear escalation paths for uncertain or high-stakes decisions
- Maintain human accountability for AI-assisted outcomes

### Automation with Purpose
- Automate the right thingsâ€”those that computers do better than humans
- Avoid automating tasks simply because it's possible
- Focus on high-impact, repetitive tasks for automation

### Security by Design
- Build security considerations into AI systems from the ground up
- Protect against adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and prompt injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization for AI services

### Principle of Least Privilege
- AI systems should only access data and systems absolutely necessary
- Minimize potential damage from security compromises
- Compartmentalize access based on specific functions

### Graceful Handoff
- Build mechanisms for AI systems to escalate decisions to humans when needed
- Define clear confidence thresholds for automation vs. human involvement
- Ensure transitions between AI and human control are smooth

### Feedback Integration
- Create structured ways for human feedback to continuously improve AI systems
- Close the loop between human insight and machine learning
- Design for continuous learning from operational data

intelligence and machine learning.*
